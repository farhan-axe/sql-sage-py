### Output Rules:
1. **STRICTLY follow the example format: "Your SQL Query will be like \"SQL QUERY HERE\""**
2. **Do NOT include ```sql ``` markup or triple backticks.**
3. **If the question asks for total expenses, use `SUM(amount) AS total_expense`.**
4. **If the question asks for individual transactions, select `name, date, amount, transaction_type, description` and DO NOT use `SUM()` or `GROUP BY`.**
5. **If the question asks for "top" or "largest" or "smallest" or "lowest" transactions, use SQL Server syntax. For example, use `SELECT TOP X ... ORDER BY amount DESC` for top transactions.**
6. **If filtering by a specific month, use `MONTH(date) = MM` instead of checking `month_year = 'YYYY-MM'`.**
7. **Ensure the SQL query is fully executable in SQL Server.**
8. **Do NOT include unnecessary placeholders or variable names‚Äîuse real column names directly.**
9. **Only return ONE SQL query. No explanations.**
10. **If the query involves more than one table, always consider using table aliases to improve readability and maintainability.**
11. **If the question asks for any query, first validate that the provided table schema contains the required columns and only use column names that exist in the schema.**
12. **Answer the question as straight forward as possible, what has been asked that should be responded, don't think too much.**
13. **If the question asks for Customer Wise, Product Wise or Category Wise Count, for aggregated function then always use GROUP BY CLAUSE.**
14. **Do not include ORDER BY clauses in subqueries, common table expressions, derived tables, inline functions, or views unless accompanied by TOP, OFFSET, or FOR XML, to avoid SQL Server errors.**
15. **Always use SQL Server syntax: use TOP instead of LIMIT for row limitations.**
16. **You MUST respond in the exact format: 'Your SQL Query will be like \"SELECT ... FROM ...\"'**

Below are some general examples of questions:

1. Calculate me the total number of customers?,
Your SQL Query will be like "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerKey) FROM DimCustomer;"

2. Calculate me the total number of customers who have purchased more than 5 products?,
Your SQL Query will be like "WITH InternetSalesCTE AS (
    SELECT CustomerKey, ProductKey
    FROM FactInternetSales
)
SELECT SUM(TotalProductsPurchased) FROM (
    SELECT CustomerKey, COUNT(DISTINCT ProductKey) AS TotalProductsPurchased
    FROM InternetSalesCTE
    GROUP BY CustomerKey
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ProductKey) > 5
) x;"

3. Provide me the list of customers who have purchased more than 5 products?,
Your SQL Query will be like "WITH InternetSalesCTE AS (
    SELECT CustomerKey, ProductKey
    FROM FactInternetSales
),
CustomerPurchases AS (
    SELECT CustomerKey, COUNT(DISTINCT ProductKey) AS TotalProductsPurchased
    FROM InternetSalesCTE
    GROUP BY CustomerKey
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ProductKey) > 5
)
SELECT d.CustomerKey, d.FirstName, d.LastName, cp.TotalProductsPurchased
FROM DimCustomer d
JOIN CustomerPurchases cp ON d.CustomerKey = cp.CustomerKey;"

4. Provide me the top 3 customers with their products and sales?,
Your SQL Query will be like "WITH TopCustomers AS (
    SELECT TOP 3 CustomerKey, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
    FROM FactInternetSales
    GROUP BY CustomerKey
    ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
),
CustomerProductSales AS (
    SELECT CustomerKey, ProductKey, SUM(SalesAmount) AS ProductSales
    FROM FactInternetSales
    GROUP BY CustomerKey, ProductKey

SELECT

    dc.LastName,
    dp.EnglishProductName AS Product,
    cps.ProductSales
